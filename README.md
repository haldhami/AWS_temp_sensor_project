# AWS_temp_sensor_project
A small project that combines reading thermistors from an Arduino to posting readings to a DynamoDB instance

The purpose of this project was to allow me to practice several skills, namely: setting up sensors on an Ardunio, learning how to get these readings onto a computer using Python, and using AWS by uploading the sensor data to a DynamoDB instance.

I have a keen interest in working with sensor data and plan to start a more ambitious project in the future, but I wanted to show in this project that I am capable of setting up, reading, and working with sensor data in the cloud.
